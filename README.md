- Hi! I'm Onat Erdem.
- I’m interested in video games of all kinds, art, technology, and science.
- I’m currently working as a software engineer for TaleWorlds Entertainment, in the UI team.
- I don't have any repos or projects on my profile because I haven't really had time for leisure projects and don't use GitHub much anyway. Blame METU CENG for swamping me with too many assignments!

<!---
Onaterdem/Onaterdem is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
